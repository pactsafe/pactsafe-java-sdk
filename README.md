### pactsafe-java-sdk

A Java client for the [PactSafe](https://www.pactsafe.com) Activity API. Integrate into any application for secure legal record-keeping.

## Installation

Download the [release](https://github.com/pactsafe/pactsafe-java-sdk/releases) or clone to build with `mvn clean install`.
*Coming soon to maven-central.*
```
<dependency>
  <groupId>com.pactsafe</groupId>
  <artifactId>pactsafe-java-sdk</artifactId>
  <version>{version}</version>
</dependency>
```


## Initialization

Initialize the Activity client, passing your PactSafe Site's `access_id` String as the first argument.
```java
Activity site = new Activity("ACCESS_KEY");
```

## Configuration

The second argument to the `Activity` constructor is an optional `ParameterStore` object of properties for the Activity client.
```java
ParameterStore parameters = new ParameterStore();
parameters.setTestMode(true);
Activity site = new Activity("ACCESS_KEY", parameters);
```

The third argument is an optional `ActivityOptions` object of client configuration settings.
```java
ActivityOptions options = new ActivityOptions();
options.setHost("https://pactsafe.io");      //optional
Activity site = new Activity("ACCESS_KEY", parameters, options);
```

## Parameters

Every Action sent to the PactSafe Activity API is built from the parameters stored on the Activity client. These parameter values can be set or retrieved at any point.
```java
ParameterStore parameters = site.getParameters();
parameters.setPageTitle("Registration Page");
site.setParameters(parameters);
```

## Load

The `load` method lets you load the properties and content of a clickwrap Group by key.
```java
Group group = site.load("GROUP_KEY");
```

Optionally, you can pass a custom `Map<String, Object>` as `renderData` for the second argument -- allowing you to alter the content each time the Group is loaded. For this reason, every response from the `load` request provides a unique `render_id` to use for activity tracking.
```java
renderDataMap.put("order_id", 123456);
renderDataMap.put("company_name", "Example LLC");
Group group = site.load("GROUP_KEY", renderDataMap);
```

## Retrieve

The `retrieve` method lets you load a Signer's acceptance history for a given set of Contract IDs.

Providing a `signer_id` and an array of `contracts`, the response will contain a map of each Contract ID and its most recently accepted Version ID.
```java
List<Integer> contractIds = new ArrayList<Integer>();
contractIds.add(1);
contractIds.add(4);
Map<Integer, String> retrieve = activity.retrieve("SIGNER_ID", contractIds);
```

When invoked from a group object, the contracts from the group will be automatically loaded.
```java
Map<Integer, String> retrieve = group.retrieve("SIGNER_ID");
```


## Latest

The `latest` method tells you if a Signer has accepted the latest Version for a given set of Contract IDs.

This method is similar to the `retrieve` method, but instead of providing the actual Version ID that was last accepted, the response contains a boolean `true` or `false` for each contract ID.

```java
Map<Integer, Boolean> latest = activity.latest("SIGNER_ID", contractIds);
```

When invoked from a group object, the contracts from the group will be automatically loaded.
```java
Map<Integer, Boolean> latest = activity.latest("SIGNER_ID");
```

## Send

The `send` method lets you track a Signer Action by sending data to the PactSafe Activity API.

Provide an option from the `EventType` enum, as well as any parameters to save on the Action. The `signerId` parameter and `renderId` are required for most event types.

```java
ParameterStore action = new ParameterStore();
action.setSignerId("john@example.com");
action.setRenderId(group.getParameters().getRenderId());
action.setPageTitle("My Test Page Title");

site.send(EventType.UPDATED, action);
```

## Agreed

The `agreed` method sends a Signer Action to the PactSafe Activity API with the event type `agreed`.

Provide a `signer_id`, as well as any parameters to save on the Action. If the content being accepted was assigned a `render_id`, be sure to include that same `render_id` in the Action parameters.

```java
ParameterStore action = new ParameterStore();
action.setSignerId("john@example.com");
action.setRenderId(group.getParameters().getRenderId());
Map<String, Object> customData = new HashMap<String, Object>();
customData.put("order_id", 123456);
customData.put("sku", "MYTX772");
action.setCustomData(customData);

site.agreed(action);
```

## Exceptions

All methods outside of `Activity` initialization are designed to throw a `PactSafeActivityException` Exception should an issue arrise in the processing of your request. Additionally, an `IllegalArgumentException` will be raised should illegal arguments be passed.

## Development

For development, you can enable the `test_mode` parameter when the client is initialized. Any Signers or Actions created within test mode can be easily cleared from your account.
```java
ParameterStore parameters = new ParameterStore();
parameters.setTestMode(true);
Activity site = new Activity("ACCESS_KEY", parameters);
```
